  "overview": "The idea agent went ahead and fixed an issue during the brainstorming process, which is unintended behavior. The idea stage should be about exploration and planning, not implementation.\n\n**Motivation:** Preserve the separation between idea brainstorming and implementation phases. Users may not expect code changes during ideation.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Idea agent checks for local changes in the codebase before proceeding\n- Warning shown to user if there are uncommitted changes\n- Guardrails prevent the agent from making code changes during brainstorm\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Check for local git changes before allowing modifications\n- Do not block workflow but show warnings to user\n- Add safeguards within idea agent to prevent code modification operations\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium",
