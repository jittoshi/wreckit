  "overview": "Implement configurable limits for max iterations, max duration, max budget USD, and no-progress threshold to prevent runaway agent execution or excessive costs.\n\n**Motivation:** Prevents resource waste and cost overruns from agent tasks that hang or loop indefinitely.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- max_iterations stops loop after limit\n- max_duration_hours stops loop after time limit\n- max_budget_usd warns when exceeded\n- no_progress_threshold stops after no changes\n- Limits configurable per implementation\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium",
