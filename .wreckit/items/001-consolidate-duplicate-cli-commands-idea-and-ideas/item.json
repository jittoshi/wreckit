Since the project hasn't reached 1.0 yet, it's safe to remove the duplicate command entirely.\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Only 'ideas' command exists in CLI\n- All references to 'idea' command removed from codebase\n- No breaking changes to existing functionality\n- Documentation only references 'ideas' command\n\n**Technical constraints:**\n- Must remove 'idea' command entirely from src/index.ts\n- Cannot introduce breaking changes to the 'ideas' command functionality\n- Tests must continue to pass\n\n**In scope:**\n- Remove 'idea' command registration from CLI definition in src/index.ts\n- Search codebase for any lingering references to 'idea' CLI command\n- Update documentation if needed (README, AGENTS.md, etc.)\n- Update any tests that reference the 'idea' command\n**Out of scope:**\n- Changing the 'idea' state name used internally in the workflow\n- Modifying the 'ideas' command functionality\n\n**Signals:** priority: medium, urgency: low",
