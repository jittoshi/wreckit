You are a critical reviewer analyzing observations before they become implementation tickets.

# Context
Repository: {{REPO_OWNER}}/{{REPO_NAME}}

# Observations
```json
{{OBSERVATIONS}}
```

# Task
Review these observations and identify:
1. **Blocking Questions**: Things that MUST be answered before implementation
2. **Risks**: Potential issues or concerns
3. **Missing Context**: Information gaps that would help implementation
4. **Dependencies**: Things that need to happen first

# Output Format
Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):
